## Description

This Wildfly module lets you use Puppet to install, deploy and configure multiple WildFly's  (standalone only).   

The module is based/uses code from the following modules:  

* biemond-wildfly: https://github.com/biemond/biemond-wildfly
* puppetlabs-tomcat: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-tomcat

The best scenario would have been incorporating this code in the biemond-wildfly module, it is an issue: https://github.com/biemond/biemond-wildfly/issues/149  

But we decided to give it our own twist and release this module, it is in NO WAY a real alternative to the biemond-wildfly module, it lacks a lot of features we would like to add, by releasing it to the public we hope to get movement on this module and improve the quality.  Be free to test this release and make (major) PR's available for us.  

## Setup

### What wildfly affects  

It will install a WildFly version by your choice in a given directory.  

### Setup Requirements  

This module requires the following modules:  
- [puppet-puppetlabs-stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib)
- [puppet-voxpupuli-archive](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-archive)

### Beginning with wildfly

This module is multi-based, it is not possible to just include the module and be done with it.  
It requires at least these lines of code to get a working installation.  

## Usage

The most basic usage would be the following:  

```
wildfly::install { 'wildfly8':
  catalina_home => '/opt/wildfly8',
  source        => 'http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/8.2.1.Final/wildfly-8.2.1.Final.tar.gz',
}
wildfly::instance { 'wildfly8':
  catalina_home  => '/opt/wildfly8',
  manage_service => true,
  port_properties => { "management-http" => 19990, "management-https" => 19993, "ajp" => 18009, "http" => 18080, "https" => 18443, },
}
```

This will install WildFly version 8 in /opt/wildfly8 with custom portnumbers. Note that the 'catalina_home' variable is the leading variable which determines which WildFly instance is configured.
